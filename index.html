 <h2>Interests</h2>
 <p>Outside of work and school, I spend most of my time reading, gaming, and playing sports. I love reading fantasy novels, but I participate in a book club to broaden the authors and genres I read. I built a PC for video gaming and primarily play RPGs and horror games. I also love strategy board games like Catan, Monopoly, and Betrayal at the House on the Hill. I play in multiple sports leagues, including two soccer leagues, a pick-up frisbee league, and a beach volleyball league. I love living in Los Angeles because the year-round temperate weather allows me to be active and spend time outside no matter the season!</p>
